Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate.   Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic. Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us.   I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro.   They have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.  Update 11/8/2010 Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends.  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do.    We arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio.  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again.  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.  Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.  We ordered beignets, apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight.  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good.  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all.  Jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Great food and even better beer.

This is the only hamburger that I have liked the next day - usually hamburger is the one food that is not a good take home food as it just does not taste good as a left over - but I have actually eaten it cold because I took a bite before heating it and just kept going...yes, weird I know.  If nothing else, go there for some avocado egg rolls and then treat yourself to a cheesecake....I'm totally addicted! Absolute divine decadence! ;D\n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The only thing you can say critically about the Thai House is the location isn't a home run.  But get past that, and get inside because the food is top shelf and the recepies are authentic making this a fave five spot for my family.  Start with a Thai Iced Tea, try a spicy soup, and don't miss the curry - but beware of the heat index and order according to your ability to enjoy flame in your flavor!  My personal favorite is tradtional Pad Thai - the perfect balance of peanut and chili spice with sticky noodles & chicken...\n","3  Brought a group to Metro for brunch, made the reservation a month ago, called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation. Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate.   Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic. Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us.   I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro.   They have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.  Update 11/8/2010 Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends.  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do.    We arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio.  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again.  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.  Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.  We ordered beignets, apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight.  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good.  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all.  Jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section.\n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Great food and even better beer.
