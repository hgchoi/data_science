# Predicting Wildfire Sizes in California Using Machine Learning

We utilized data consisting of 2 weeks of leading and trailing meteorological factors (including temperature, wind, and humidity) relative to the ignition date of a wildfire event.
In light of recent events, we think that this project is a step towards preventing future wildfires and bringing awareness towards global warming so that we can reduce the chances of future wildfires.
