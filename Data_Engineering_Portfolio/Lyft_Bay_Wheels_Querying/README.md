# Lyft Bay Wheels Querying 

In this query project, I used SQL while learning about Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and BiqQuery. I created and answered business-driven questions using public datasets housed in GCP. To get more experience with different ways to use these datasets, I used the web UI (BiqQuery) and command-line tools in Jupyter Notebooks.

### Problem Statement

As a data scientist at Lyft Bay Wheels (https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels), formerly known as Ford GoBike, the company running Bay Area Bikeshare. I am trying to increase ridership, and want to offer deals through the mobile app to do so.

What deals do I offer? Currently, Lyft Bay Wheels has several options which can change over time. Frequent offers include:

* Single Ride 
* Monthly Membership 
* Annual Membership 
* Bike Share for All Access Pass 
* Corporate Membership 
* etc.

Through this project, I will answer these questions:

* What are the 5 most popular trips that you would call "commuter trips"?

* What are your recommendations for offers (justify based on your findings)?
